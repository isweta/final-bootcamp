Edit Neutron configuration file /etc/neutron/neutron.conf to specify Vyatta vRouter L3 plugin:

service_plugins =
neutron.plugins.brocade.vyatta.vrouter_neutron_plugin.VyattaVRouterPlugin


Plugins are registered by adding the following to the localrc section of local.conf.

They are added in the following format:

[[local|localrc]]
enable_plugin brocadevrouter https://github.com/stackforge/networking-brocade.git

I downloaded version 1.4.5-1ubuntu1 from https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-amqp (Launchpad) and installed it manually. The next call to devstack worked.
