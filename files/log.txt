How to share folders between Windows and Ubuntu using VMware Player

Create a folder in your Windows file system that you want to use as the share. Make sure it’s in a location where your user account has full access rights.
Power down the VM shutting down Ubuntu
Select your VM in VMware Player and click Edit virtual machine settings 
VMware Player: edit virtual machine settings
In the Options tab click Shared Folders in the left hand pane 
VMware Player: settings & options
 Click Always enabled in the right and pane and click Add…
This will take you into the “Add Shared Folder Wizard” 
VMware Player: Add Shared Folder Wizard
Click Next and follow the prompts selecting the folder you created in Step 1
Also name the share – this is the name that the folder will have in Ubuntu
You will come back to the Settings screen with your share added 
VMware Player: folder sharing enabled
Click OK to close the settings
Play the VM to boot Ubuntu
Shared folders in Ubuntu appear in the location /mnt/hgfs but you probably won’t be able to see it
To check to see if Ubuntu is aware that there is a shared folder available run thi
s command in a terminal window vmware-hgfsclient 
This will output the share name into the terminal window, e.g. 
$ vmware-hgfsclient WinLinShare
So far so good! Now we need to run the VMWare config tools. In terminal enter sudo vmware-config-tools.pl
Follow the prompts, accepting the default values
Check to see that your folder is now showing in the /mnt/hgfs directory $ dir /mnt/hgfs WinLinShare
Share folder permissions across Ubuntu Virtual Machine & Windows Host
Finally, here’s a little trick to share folder permissions across Ubuntu Virtual Machine & Windows Host. This also gives you quick access to the folder from your Ubuntu desktop. Enter this into terminal:

ln -s /mnt/hgfs/shared-directory ~/Desktop/Name-of-the-folder  
And there you have it, your Windows folder is now fully accessible and usable from your Ubuntu VM. The script files for the rest of my Knowing Node series will be based in this directory.
